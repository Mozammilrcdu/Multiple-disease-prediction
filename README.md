# Multiple Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning  

This repository contains a **Multiple Disease Prediction** project. The application predicts the likelihood of three diseases—**Heart Disease**, **Diabetes**, and **Parkinson's Disease**—using machine learning models trained on datasets sourced from Kaggle. The app is built with **Streamlit**, providing a user-friendly interface for making predictions.
